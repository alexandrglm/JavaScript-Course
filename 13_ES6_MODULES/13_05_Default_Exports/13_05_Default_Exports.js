/*
 * 05-096: Default Exports, along with other imports
 * 
 * Check ../13_01_testNode/src/* to get how an object can be considered
 * as Default, with itw own syntax (`export default function/object`),
 * and, also, how it's imported, alone, and among other kind ob objects.
 * 
 * The Script for this guide has been renamed to Default_Exports_Guide05096.js
 * due to JS limitations on how this kind of objects can be named.
